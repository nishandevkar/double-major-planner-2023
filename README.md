### Project description:
A study plan helps students to plan their sequence of units for a university course. Undergraduate courses may have two different majors. Currently, study plans are created by hand based on one or two majors or minors, each or which is defined by a unit sequence, prerequisite rules, and semester availability, which are stored in UWA's CAIDi curriculum management system. This project aims to automate the process of building a study plan for a given double major. The Double Major Study Planner software will:
1. For a given University program comprising 2 majors, automatically create a feasible study plan for students starting either in semester 1 or 2 satisfying given constraints for both majors (core units, prerequisites, semester availability).
2. Generate a visualisation of double major study plan. The visualisation could be static (eg pdf, powerpoint or html) or dynamic (eg a web application). Users should be able to visualise and edit the output.
3. Allow students or staff to propose adjustments to a study plan such as the addition or deletion of units
4. Allow students to download a completed study plan and upload an existing plan to make changes
